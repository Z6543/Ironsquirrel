# #IRONSQUIRREL

This project aims at delivering browser exploits to the victim browser in an encrypted fashion. Ellyptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (secp256k1) is used for key agreement, and AES is used for encryption.

By delivering the exploit code (and shellcode) to the victim in an encrypted way, the attack can not be replayed. Meanwhile, the HTML/JS source is encrypted; thus reverse engineering the exploit is significantly harder.   

If you have no idea what I am talking about, Google for "How to hide your browser 0-days" and check my presentation. Alternatively, check out it on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyMDd98uljI

## Getting Started

These instructions get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Mandatory dependencies - clone the IRONSQUIRREL project, cd into the project directory, and run the following commands:
```
sudo apt-get install ruby-dev
bundle install
```
Actually nokogiri and gibberish gems will be installed.

Optional dependency (for Powershell based environment aware encrypted payload delivery): Ebowla
https://github.com/Genetic-Malware/Ebowla

### Installing

1. Clone the IRONSQUIRREL project
2. Install the prerequisites
3. (Optional) Edit IRONSQUIRREL.rb 
   1. Change the listen port
   2. If Ebowla is used, configure the paths
4. (Optional) If Ebowla is used, configure genetic.config.ecdh in the Ebowla install directory
5. Run IRONSQUIRREL.rb

```
ruby IRONSQUIRREL.rb --exploit full_path_to_exploit
```
### Example
```
ruby IRONSQUIRREL.rb --exploit /home/myawesomeusername/IRONSQUIRREL/exploits/alert.html
```
After that, visit the webserver from a browser. 
Example output: 
```
Listening on 2345
GET / HTTP/1.1
GET /sjcl.js HTTP/1.1
GET /dh.js HTTP/1.1
GET /client_pub.html?cl=SOifQJetphU2CvFzZl239nKPYWRGEH23ermGMszo9oqOgqIsH5XxXi1vw4P4YFWDqK6v4o4jIpAVSNZD1x5NTw%3D%3D HTTP/1.1
GET /final.html HTTP/1.1
GET /sjcl.js HTTP/1.1
The end
```

## Deployment instructions for production environments
1. Let me know if you use this for real
2. Spend at least 2 weeks to figure out what could go wrong
